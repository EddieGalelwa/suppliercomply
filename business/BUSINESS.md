### Initial Outreach

```
Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] from SupplierComply.

I help small medical suppliers meet KEMSA's new GS1 barcode requirements by December 2026.

Quick question: How are you currently creating barcodes for your products? Most suppliers I talk to are struggling with Excel templates and manual errors.

I built a simple tool that generates GS1-compliant barcodes instantly and auto-fills KEMSA reports. Takes 10 minutes to set up.

[0:15-0:45] First, let's look at your dashboard. Here you can see your barcode usage, payment status, and any expiry alerts. Your payment code is displayed here - save this for when you upgrade.

[0:45-1:30] Now let's generate your first barcode. Click "Generate Barcode", enter your product details - name, batch number, expiry date. The GTIN is auto-generated for you. Click generate, and there's your GS1-compliant barcode, ready to download and print.

[1:30-2:15] Next, the KEMSA export. Upload your inventory CSV, map your columns to KEMSA fields, preview the data, and download the Excel file. It's already in the exact format KEMSA requires.

[2:15-2:45] Finally, payment. When you're ready to upgrade, go to the upgrade page, pay via M-Pesa to Paybill 247247 using your payment code, click "I Have Paid", and we'll activate your account within 5 minutes.

[0:00-0:10] Let me show you how to generate a GS1-compliant barcode in under a minute.

[0:10-0:30] Go to the Barcode Generator page. Enter your product name - let's say "Paracetamol 500mg Tablets". Add your batch number and expiry date.

[0:30-0:50] The GTIN field is optional - we'll auto-generate a valid GTIN-14 for you. But if you have your own GS1 prefix, you can enter it here.

[0:50-1:15] Click "Generate Barcode". And there it is - a print-ready GS1-128 barcode at 300 DPI. You can download the PNG or print directly.

[1:15-1:45] The barcode includes all the GS1 data: GTIN, batch number, expiry date, and quantity. It's fully compliant with KEMSA requirements.

[0:15-0:45] First, prepare your CSV. You need at minimum: Product Name and Quantity. But we also recommend: Batch Number, Expiry Date, and Unit of Measure. Save it as a CSV file.

[0:45-1:15] Go to KEMSA Export, drag and drop your CSV file. Our system will detect your columns and suggest mappings. Review the suggestions and adjust if needed.

[1:15-1:45] Click "Preview" to see how your data will look. We'll validate everything and flag any errors. Fix any issues in your CSV and re-upload.

[1:45-2:15] Once everything looks good, click "Download Excel". You'll get a perfectly formatted KEMSA template with all your data. Just upload this file to the KEMSA portal.

[2:15-2:30] Free users can preview but not download. Upgrade to unlock full Excel downloads. Start your free trial today!

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"

```
I understand KSh 15,000 might seem like a lot. Let me break it down:

- That's KSh 500 per day
- One rejected shipment costs more than a year of SupplierComply
- Manual Excel work takes 5+ hours/month - what's your time worth?

Plus, you get:
✓ Unlimited barcodes
✓ No more KEMSA rejection headaches
✓ Expiry alerts (save stock from expiring)

Most suppliers save money within the first month.

Want to try it free for 14 days first?
```

### "I can do this in Excel"

```
You're right, Excel can work. But let me ask:

- How long does it take you to format one KEMSA report?
- Have you ever had a shipment rejected for barcode errors?
- Who checks your GTIN check digits?

SupplierComply:
→ Generates barcodes in 10 seconds (vs 10 minutes in Excel)
→ Validates all GS1 data automatically
→ Exports exact KEMSA format (no manual formatting)
→ Alerts you before products expire

One rejected shipment costs more than a year of SupplierComply.

Worth a 14-day free trial?
```

### "I don't have time to learn new software"

```
I get it - you're busy running a business.

That's exactly why we built SupplierComply to be simple:

- 5-minute setup
- No training needed
- Generate first barcode in 2 minutes
- KEMSA export in 3 clicks

Most suppliers are up and running in their first session.

Plus, I'll personally walk you through it on a 15-minute call.

When works for you - this week or next?
```

### "The deadline is far away"

```
You're right - December 2026 seems far. But consider:

- How many products do you have? (100? 500? 1000?)
- Each needs a unique barcode
- KEMSA reports need to be accurate
- One error = rejected shipment = lost revenue

Suppliers who wait until the last minute:
❌ Rush and make mistakes
❌ Face KEMSA penalties
❌ Risk contract termination

Smart suppliers start early and do it right.

Free trial takes 2 minutes to set up. Why not start today?
